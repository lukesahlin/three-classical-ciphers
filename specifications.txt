    encrypt_one_time_pad(secret, key)
        Purpose
            The function encrypts a plaintext message using the One-Time Pad cipher, which provides perfect secrecy when the key is truly random and used only once.

        Assumptions
            The key is a string that is exactly the same length as the secret.
            Both secret and key contain only characters from the defined ALPHABET.
        Inputs
            secret (str): The plaintext message to be encrypted, consisting of uppercase letters and spaces.
            key (str): A string of equal length that serves as the key for the cipher.
        Outputs
            Returns (str): The encrypted message, also consisting of uppercase letters and spaces.
        State Changes
            The function converts both the secret and key to uppercase.
            It raises a ValueError if the lengths of secret and key are not equal.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Input: secret is incripted and you get the hidden message back.
            Invalid Length: If the lengths do not match
            Special Characters: If the secret contains characters not in the alphabet.
    decrypt_one_time_pad(encrypted_secret, key)
        Purpose
            The function decrypts a message that has been encrypted using the One-Time Pad cipher, restoring it to its original plaintext form.

        Assumptions
            The key is a string that is exactly the same length as the encrypted_secret.
            Both encrypted_secret and key consist of characters from the defined ALPHABET.
        Inputs
            encrypted_secret (str): The message that has been encrypted, consisting of uppercase letters and spaces.
            key (str): A string of equal length that was used as the key when the message was encrypted.
        Outputs
            Returns (str): The decrypted message, consisting of uppercase letters and spaces.
        State Changes
            The function converts both the encrypted_secret and key to uppercase.
            It raises a ValueError if the lengths of encrypted_secret and key are not equal.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Input: secret is decryped and returns the secret
            Invalid Length: If the lengths do not match
            Special Characters: If the encrypted_secret contains characters that are not in the alphabet.
Main.py
    option_ceasar_cipher()
        Purpose
            To encrypt or decrypt a message using the Caesar cipher based on user input.

        Assumptions
            The key for the Caesar cipher is a single letter.
            The input message can only contain uppercase letters.
        Inputs
            message (str): The message to be encrypted or decrypted.
            action (str): The user's choice of operation, either 'e' (encrypt) or 'd' (decrypt).
            key (str): A single letter used as the key for the Caesar cipher.
        Outputs
            Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message to the terminal.
        State Changes
            The function checks if the action input is valid and performs the corresponding operation.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Input: The function successfully encrypts or decrypts the message.
            Invalid Action: If the action is not 'e' or 'd', it prompts the user again via a recursive call.
    option_vigenere_cipher()
        Purpose
            To encrypt or decrypt a message using the Vigenère cipher based on user input.
        Assumptions
            The key for the Vigenère cipher is a word consisting of uppercase letters.
        Inputs
            message (str): The message to be encrypted or decrypted.
            action (str): The user's choice of operation, either 'e' (encrypt) or 'd' (decrypt).
            key (str): A word used as the key for the Vigenère cipher.
        Outputs
            Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message to the terminal.
        State Changes
            Similar to the Caesar cipher, it checks if the action input is valid.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Input: The function should eventually call the Vigenère encryption or decryption logic.
            Invalid Action: If the action is not 'e' or 'd', it prompts the user again via a recursive call.
    option_otp_cipher()
        Purpose
            To encrypt or decrypt a message using the One-Time Pad cipher based on user input.

        Assumptions
            The key must be of equal length to the message.
        Inputs
            message (str): The message to be encrypted or decrypted.
            action (str): The user's choice of operation, either 'e' (encrypt) or 'd' (decrypt).
            key (str): The key for the One-Time Pad cipher.
        Outputs
            Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message to the console.
        State Changes
            The function checks if the length of the key matches the length of the message.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Input: The function successfully encrypts or decrypts the message.
            Key Length Mismatch: If the key is not the same length as the message, it prompts the user again via a recursive call.
            Invalid Action: If the action is not 'e' or 'd', it prompts the user again via a recursive call.
    main()
        Purpose
            To provide a central menu for selecting which cipher to use.
        Assumptions
            The user can only select from the three cipher options provided.
        Inputs
            choice (str): The user's selection for which cipher to use.
        Outputs
            Calls the corresponding function based on the user's choice.
        State Changes
            It checks the user's input and calls the relevant cipher function.
        Cases and Expected Behavior
            Valid Choice: The user is taken to the appropriate cipher function.
            Invalid Choice: If the choice is not 1, 2, or 3, it prompts the user again via a recursive call.
